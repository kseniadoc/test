##Theory##
**Modeling of the profile of the transverse (or vertical) optical mode is one of the most important stages of design powerful semiconductor laser.
Optical mode is called the spatial nature of the intensity propagation of the electromagnetic radiation inside the optical resonator including the laser.**

**Mode profile I(x,y,z) refers to the spatial
propagation of the square modulus of the electric field vector of the electromagnetic wave E<SUP>2</SUP>(x,y,z).**

**In our case we are interested in simulation of vertical mode, since they are mostly determined by the refractive indexes of the layers, which form a laser heterostructure and influence not only the nature of the divergence of the laser radiation, but also directly on its capacity, efficiency, temperature sensitivity and other characteristics.**

**In physics of semiconductor lasers optical limiting factors play a big role, it describe the efficacy of the interaction of light with the field and represent the proportion of the intensity of the optical mode, which is encapsulated within a layer. 
The optical confinement factor of the active region (quantum well) defines the desired to start the generation of the gain, threshold concentration and threshold current densities.**
