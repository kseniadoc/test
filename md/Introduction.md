#Introduction#
Beamplex program is designed to simulate the spatial propagation of the transverse mode in a waveguide laser heterostructure[five layers of AlGaAs - AlGaAs - InGaAs - AlGaAs - AlGaAs for different thickness and concentration]. The calculation algorithm developed in the  CAS (computer algebra system) Mathcad, design of program interface and the creation of executables and debugging moduls conducted in the programming software IDLE. The program can be used in the design of powerful semiconductor lasers and development of new constructive solutions for the collection and analysis of the divergence of laser radiation, efficiency, temperature sensitivity, as well as in the educational purposes at studying of processes of generation of laser radiation.
Numerical mode solving methods for arbitrary waveguide based on the implicit finite-difference technique. The results of the calculation are presented in the program in the form of graphs of dependence of the field amplitude and refractive index on the coordinate from the surface of the heterostructure.
